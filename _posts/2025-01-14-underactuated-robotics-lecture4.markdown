> This is part of a series of posts on the course [MIT 6.8210: Underactuated Robotics](https://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/Spring2024/index.html) by [Prof. Russ Tedrake](https://locomotion.csail.mit.edu/russt.html). The goal is to document the key concepts and takeaways for future reference. These are <i>not</i> actual lecture notes, but a summary of the key points covered in the lecture and my thoughts on them. The official course material is available here: [lecture videos on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkx8KyIQkMfU5szP43GlE_S1QGSPQfL9s) \| [lecture notes](https://underactuated.csail.mit.edu)
